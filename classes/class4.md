#id{
    width=800px
}
</ style>
</ head>
< body>
< div id="container">
< img "50"% src="https//... >

when using div which is a new space or area in the body, the image takes a half of the container which means it will take exctly 400px
div also makes the layout more fleixable 
**div is an elements acts as a container where I can group other elements togther, it helps to group and control the elements as a unit**
